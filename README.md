Certainly! Here's a README for your repository that explores the foundations of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms and builds them from scratch without using any libraries:

# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains code files that explore the foundations of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms and implement them from scratch without relying on any external libraries. The purpose of this repository is to understand the inner workings of these algorithms and gain a deeper insight into their functionality.

2. [Algorithms](#algorithms)
3. [Code Structure](#code-structure)
4. [Running the Code](#running-the-code)
5. [Contributing](#contributing)
6. [License](#license)

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x

## Algorithms

The repository covers a range of ML and DL algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Neural Networks (NN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Long SHort Term Memory - LSTM
- Maybe transformers too!!

Each algorithm is implemented using only vanilla Python and the necessary mathematical operations. No external libraries or frameworks are used to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms' inner workings.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into separate files, with each file corresponding to a specific ML or DL algorithm. The code within each file is organized into functions and classes, providing modularity and ease of understanding. Detailed comments are provided throughout the code to explain the logic and steps involved in each algorithm.

## Running the Code

To run the code and explore the implemented ML and DL algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the desired algorithm's file.
4. Execute the code using a Python environment or an IDE.
5. Observe the output, which may include training progress, accuracy metrics, or generated results, depending on the specific algorithm.
6. Experiment with different datasets and hyperparameters to gain insights into the algorithm's behavior and performance.

Note: Although the implementations in this repository are educational and provide a solid foundation for understanding ML and DL algorithms, for practical use cases, it is recommended to use established libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
